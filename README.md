# Jake-Arrieta-Summary-2015
This is a summary of Jake Arrieta's Cy Young 2015 season. The data is from Baseball Savant. 

This is also my very first GitHub repo. Summaries.py is a work in progress where I am atempting to recreate JA_CyYoung_Dash.ipynp in the context of object oriented programming. The final goal is to be able to create adhoc summaries of any pitcher's pitch arsenal from any year that is availaibe on Baseball Savant by simply passing the corresponding CSV into the program. Later I plan to do the same for batters, and teams.
